Project Title: Hand Gesture Tracking in Videos (Guess Which Hand)

Reporting Period: Week 2

Researcher: Wang, Mian

1. Overall Progress:
Week 2 focused on conducting a comprehensive literature review to establish a strong foundation for the "Guess Which Hand" project. This involved identifying relevant research, analyzing existing methods, and understanding the current state-of-the-art in hand gesture and posture recognition. The completed literature review will be instrumental in guiding the project's technical direction in the coming weeks.

2. Specific Tasks Completed:
Literature Search and Selection: Identified and reviewed over 8 research papers, projects, and frameworks related to:
Hand tracking and gesture recognition
Human pose estimation
Action recognition
Nonverbal behavior analysis in games
Object detection (YOLO)
Analysis of Related Work: Critically analyzed similar projects (e.g., MediaPipe Hands, OpenPose) and identified their strengths and weaknesses in the context of the "Guess Which Hand" game.
Identification of Foundational Papers: Established core theoretical and methodological foundations by studying key papers like "Convolutional Pose Machines" and "Deep High-Resolution Representation Learning for Human Pose Estimation" (HRNet).
Exploration of Counter-Arguments: Considered potential limitations of the project's approach by examining research on the challenges of detecting deception using only posture analysis (e.g., Ekman's work on micro-expressions).
Determination of Main Methods: Identified potential core methods for the project, including:
YOLO for hand detection.
HRNet and OpenPose for pose estimation.
Drafting of Literature Review: Completed a 2-page literature review document summarizing the findings, including proper citations in IEEE format. The document is ready for submission/review.
Revision of Bibliography: Corrected formatting errors in the references.bib file to ensure accurate and consistent citation formatting.

3. Key Findings/Learnings:
Pose Estimation is Promising: Pose estimation techniques, particularly HRNet and OpenPose, offer a high level of accuracy in capturing body and hand landmarks, which is crucial for analyzing subtle movements in the "Guess Which Hand" game.
Multi-Modal Approach May Be Necessary: Relying solely on posture analysis might not be sufficient for accurate prediction, as suggested by research on deception detection. Exploring the integration of other cues (e.g., facial expressions, gaze) could improve the model's performance in future iterations.
Real-Time Performance is Achievable: Frameworks like MediaPipe Hands and YOLO demonstrate the feasibility of real-time hand tracking and object detection, respectively, which is important for potential real-time applications of the project.
Data Availability: The availability of open-source libraries and pre-trained models for pose estimation (e.g., OpenPose, HRNet) will accelerate the development process.

4. Challenges Encountered:
Bibliography Formatting: Initial difficulties were encountered in ensuring correct IEEE citation formatting in the Overleaf document. This was resolved by carefully revising the references.bib file.
Complexity of the Field: The breadth and depth of research in computer vision and pose estimation required significant time for thorough understanding and analysis.
