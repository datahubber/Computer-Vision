This week, I focused on creating and revising a poster to summarize my project, "Hand Gesture Tracking in Videos using YOLO V8," for presentation purposes. The poster encapsulates the key aspects of my work, including the introduction, problem definition, approaches, results, and conclusions. Below is a summary of my activities:

Poster Creation:
Designed a concise and visually appealing poster based on the project documentation.
Included sections such as:
Introduction: Outlined the "Guess Which Hand" game and the project’s goal of advancing posture recognition for gaming and human-computer interaction.
Problem Definition: Described the task of predicting the hand holding an object using video data, emphasizing challenges like occlusions and lighting variations.
Approaches: Detailed the dataset preparation (20 annotated videos), model selection (YOLO V8), and landmark generation process.
Results: Highlighted the model’s 85% accuracy in predicting hand locations.
Conclusions: Emphasized the potential of YOLO V8 for gesture recognition and its broader applications.
Added a reference to the original YOLO paper for credibility.
Poster Revision:
Reviewed the initial draft for clarity, conciseness, and visual balance.
Corrected minor typos (e.g., "APPROCHES" to "Approaches" and "Al" to "AI").
Adjusted formatting to improve readability, such as consistent section headings and alignment of text.
Ensured technical terms (e.g., "landmark generation," "pose estimation") were clearly explained for a general audience while retaining accuracy for technical readers.
Verified that the reported accuracy (85%) and key findings aligned with my project data.
Challenges Encountered
Balancing technical detail with simplicity on the poster was tricky. I had to revise some sections multiple times to avoid overwhelming viewers while still conveying the project’s significance.
Ensuring the visual layout was not cluttered required several iterations of rearranging text and graphics.
