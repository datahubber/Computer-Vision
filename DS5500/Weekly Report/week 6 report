Summary of Work Completed

This week, I focused on several key tasks to refine and advance the AI model for posture and hand position recognition in the "Guess Which Hand" game. The primary efforts were directed towards data clarification, dataset integration, and model fine-tuning using different architectures. The detailed progress is as follows:

1. Clarification of Key Features (x, y, z - corner)

Investigated the meaning and significance of the x, y, z coordinates related to body landmarks.

Ensured a clearer understanding of the coordinate system, particularly how it represents hand positions and posture movements.

Verified the consistency of these values across different frames to improve data accuracy and preprocessing.

2. Data Integration: Combining Two CSV Files

Merged two CSV datasets containing posture and hand position annotations to create a unified dataset.

Handled missing or redundant data to ensure consistency and reliability.

Implemented necessary preprocessing steps to align the features and annotations from both sources.

3. Model Fine-Tuning

a. Using Pre-Trained Models

Experimented with pre-trained pose estimation models to improve the recognition accuracy.

Compared model outputs to understand their effectiveness in detecting subtle movements and hand positions.

Adjusted model parameters to adapt to the dataset characteristics.

b. Fast RNN Implementation

Implemented a Fast Recurrent Neural Network (Fast RNN) to analyze sequential movement data.

Evaluated its performance in recognizing subtle variations in hand gestures over time.

Adjusted hyperparameters for better efficiency in detecting real-time movements.

c. YOLO + LSTM Approach

Combined YOLO for real-time object detection with LSTM for temporal sequence analysis.

Tested the effectiveness of this hybrid approach in identifying hand positions dynamically.

Initial results show promise in tracking movements, though further optimization is required.

Challenges Faced

Interpreting the exact influence of x, y, z coordinates on the model's predictions.

Ensuring smooth integration of the two datasets without introducing inconsistencies.

Balancing computational efficiency while implementing LSTM with YOLO for sequence recognition.

Next Steps

Further refine the pre-trained models by optimizing hyperparameters and increasing dataset diversity.

Conduct more extensive testing on the Fast RNN and YOLO+LSTM models to determine the most effective approach.

Begin implementation of real-time inference capabilities to enhance model usability for live gameplay analysis.

Explore additional data augmentation techniques to improve robustness across different player movements and postures.

Conclusion

This weekâ€™s progress made significant strides in both data processing and model development. By clarifying key data points, integrating datasets, and exploring different deep learning techniques, the project is moving closer to achieving a reliable AI-based posture recognition system for the "Guess Which Hand" game. The next phase will focus on refining and evaluating these models to ensure accurate and efficient predictions.
